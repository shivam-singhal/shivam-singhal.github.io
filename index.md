I cofounded [Structured](https://www.structuredlabs.com) to build better data infrastructure.

We build code generation and cataloging software that data teams use to analyze large datasets.

I write [Take Five](https://shivamsinghal.substack.com/) and [the Structured Blog](https://structuredlabs.substack.com/).
